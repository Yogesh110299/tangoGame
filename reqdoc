•	 = A “Safe” symbol (like a shield icon), (Prepared resource, backup, redundant service)
•	 = A “Risk” symbol (like a warning triangle), (Exposure, untested plan, single point of failure).
•	== Equal number of safe and risk in this row/column.
•	X= These two adjacent cells cannot be the same symbol.
[Instruction Box]
•	Fill each cell with either a Safe or a Risk icon.
•	No more than 2 of the same symbols can be adjacent (Horizontally or vertically).
•	Follow hints like ‘=’ for equal counts and ‘X’ for separation.
•	Complete the puzzle to unlock a BCP tip or scenario!
Goal:
•	Fill the grid following rules to simulate balanced risk management and operational resilience.



Rules:
•	Each cell must be filled with either a Shield (Safe) or Warning (Risk).
•	No more than 2 of the same symbols can be adjacent (Horizontally or vertically).
•	Some cells will be pre-filled to start.
•	Rows and columns may have hints:
o	‘=’ symbol: Equal number of Safe and Risk symbols in this row/column.
o	‘X’ symbol: These two adjacent cells cannot have the same symbol.
•	When completed, a success message display with a BCP tip or question.

Concept:
•	A “Safe” symbol (like a shield icon)
•	A “Risk” symbol (like a warning triangle)
Rules:
•	No more than 2 of the same type (Safe or Risk) can be adjacent horizontal or vertical.
•	Each row/column might have a pre-set number of safes/risks.
•	Some cells may be pre-filled.
•	Special BCP scenarios can be revealed as players clear sections of the grid correctly.

BCP Themes to Integrate:
•	Safe Cells = Prepared assets, data backups, recovery plans in place.
•	Risk cells= Single points of failure, untested recovery procedures, or system vulnerabilities.
Optional rule ideas:
•	“=” Lines indicate equal numbers of Safe and Risk in that row/column.
•	‘X’ lines indicate those two cells can’t have the same symbol (Like segregation of duties or backup site separation).
•	Completing the grid triggers a short BCP tip or scenario reflection question.



How to Host on Share Point:
•	Use custom HTML + JavaScript embedded web part (possible in modern SharePoint Online) to host the puzzle.
•	Or use Power Apps integrated into SharePoint to make an interactive version.
•	Add leaderboards, time tracking, or badges for completions.
•	Display BCP tips or mini-scenarios on successful puzzle completion (like “ You have successfully balanced your DR site workloads!” or “Well Done! You’ve Balanced Your BCP Plan!”).
Leaderboard (Optional)
•	Fastest Times
•	Most Puzzles Completed This Month
Gamification Extras:
•	Time your completion and display top 5 fastest on SharePoint.
•	Include a “Did You know?” BCP fact after each round.
•	Reward participation with a digital badge or e-certificate.
Gamification Benefits:
•	Engage staff with BCP concepts in a fun, interactive way.
•	Reinforces operational resilience principles (redundancy segregation, balanced distribution of risk).
•	Promote awareness about disaster recovery planning in a casual setting.
•	Can tie into quarterly BCP awareness campaigns or tabletop exercises.


Recommended Rounds Structure
•	Total Rounds: 4 (Each round with increasing difficulty and a focused BCP theme)
Round 1: Basics Of Risk Identification
Puzzle Difficulty: Easy ( 4x4 or 5x5 grid)
BCP Tip: Identifying risks early is the first step to ensuring operational resilience. Regularly review your single point of failure.
Round 2: Backup and Redundancy Planning:
Puzzle Difficulty: Medium (5x5 grid with X and = constraints)
BCP Tip: Ensure critical system have redundant backups. Testing your failover plans regularly can prevent unexpected downtime.

Round 3 : Crisis Response and Communication Flow
Puzzle Difficulty: Challenging(6X6 grid)
BCP Tip: Effective crisis communication ensures timely information reaches the right people. Define and test your communication matrix quarterly.

Round 4: End-to-End BCP Simulation
Puzzle Difficulty: Advanced (7x7 with tight constraints)
BCP Tip: A well-tested BCP covers people’s processes, and technology. Regular end-to-end simulations improve recovery time objectives (RTO) and resilience readiness.
Additional Ideas:
•	Unlock each round sequentially as the previous one is completed.
•	Display a fun fact or BCP incident case study snippet after each puzzle.
•	Include a leaderboard by total rounds completed and average completion time.

Round 1 – The Great Coffee Spill Crisis
In 2019, a panicked intern at a tech firm spilled an entire cup of coffee onto the main server. The Company had no BCP or redundant system.
Results: 6 hours of downtime, no access to email and a new office rule: no beverages near IT equipment. Lesson: Protect your assets- and your coffee.
Round 2 – The Wi-Fi Apocalypse
A famous retail chain’s entire branch network went down because someone unplugged the router to charge their phone. 
No internet, no BCP call tree and no sales for 4 hours,
Moral: Always plan for the human factor. and maybe invest in a multi-port charger.
 
Round 3 – The mystery IT Guy
During a planned data center drill, the company realized no one knew how to initiate the recovery plan because the IT guy had left.. 3 years ago. There was no updated contact list.
BCP Tip: Update your escalation matrix before your IT guy turns into an urban legend.

Round 4: The Zombie Invasion tabletop”
A team ran BCP tabletop exercise using a zombie outbreak scenario. It went viral and the fake news reached the local media, The company had to issue a press release clarifying it wasn’t real.
Lesson: Creative BCP scenarios are great- just remember to tell everyone it’s a drill.
